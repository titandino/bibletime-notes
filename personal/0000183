<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Hatred for other Christians blinds us from being able to see God's light because all we are focusing on is ourselves in those emotions.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The word hatred here can also be covered by apathy as well. Apathy is something people don't generally associate with hatred.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Apathy being included here means that ignoring sin in each other's lives counts as being blinded and in the darkness as well because that is still only focusing on our own feelings in the moment.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Being afraid of losing a friendship or having someone respond poorly to criticism and letting them walk in darkness is putting our own motives above loving the other person.</li></ul></body></html>
