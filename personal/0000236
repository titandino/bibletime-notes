<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The sacrifices having to be the top most perfect males is a good representation of Jesus. Gentle non-aggressive animals that are highly valued and of high usefulness to humans.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Washing guts showing that inner purity is incredibly important to God.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Less required of those who genuinely cannot afford to give more showing that the love of God is not limited to those with material wealth or success.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Although what is required scales to the ability to offer based on wealth, it still is the most perfect example specimen that is required from God. We are to give our best in life to God as a sacrifice to please Him. Half-effort is not good enough.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Anything impure cannot approach God. Anything that wishes to approach Him must have been made clean and holy.</li></ul></body></html>
