<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">God calls all people who have received Christ children of God. This label is something not even given to the first humans.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Children of God is not just simply a label, but we actually are through Christ.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">We should be expected to be treated the same way Jesus was treated by the world.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">If we are going to be treated the same way as Christ, we should be defending the faith the same way that Christ defended it.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Jesus had many people who were extremely displeased with Him to say the least. If our defense of the faith with worldly people does not ever illicit the same kinds of responses as the Pharisees gave to Jesus towards us, we probably are watering down the truth a bit too much.</li></ul></body></html>
