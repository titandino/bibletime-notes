You cannot be forgiven without knowing you need to be forgiven for something.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Trying to make ourselves good enough for God on our own is not possible and is actually incredibly arrogant. It is nothing but the sin of pride blinding us and discounting the work that Jesus has done for us.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">On the other hand, it is prideful and arrogant to think that our sins are too great for God to forgive through the blood of Jesus. Jesus' work can redeem any sin that has been committed in the past through true repentance.</li></ul></body></html>
