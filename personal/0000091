<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Taking pleasure in unrighteousness is a massive driver of people's actions in modern culture. People decide not to have kids because they would rather &quot;live their best lives&quot;. People refuse to love the truth of God because many sins are condemnations of natural human desires for pleasures that are immoral.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">People would rather be in a neutral position of non-belief because they would rather not be confrontational or controversial. Truth is controversial especially when a massive subset of the world population believe the truth about humanity to be something entirely different.</p></body></html>
