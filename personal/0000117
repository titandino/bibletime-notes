So many extremely intelligent people who are desperate to know more and more about how the world works, yet whenever they think they know everything, something like quantum mechanics hits them in the face and they have to act as if they suspected it all along. It's a never ending never fulfilling cycle unless the focus is on God and trying to understand Him.</p></body></html>
