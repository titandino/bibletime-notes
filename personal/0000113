Scripture itself promises that we will suffer. God's protection means that our suffering will never be random. Nothing will reach us before being sifted through God's hands. All suffering we go through is enough for us to handle with His help and all suffering has the purpose of living our lives out to better glorify Him. Suffering can provide great testimony to the peace God can give during the hardest times.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Romans 5:3-8 - Suffering produces character and changes who we are. If it isn't actively changing our character then we are not having the correct perspective on challenges in life.</p></body></html>
