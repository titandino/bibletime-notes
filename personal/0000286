<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Point 2 of this sermon: Jesus Died.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Jesus' death was not accidental and He was not a victim.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This death was a part of God's plan to redeem His people to Himself. The blood of Christ was planned from the beginning of time.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">God requires payment for every sin and in His mercy, He allowed Jesus to come to pay for our sins and provide a way for us to be in fellowship with Him.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Peter is extremely quick to mention that not only was this God's plan, but it was our sin that put Jesus on that cross. We are severely imperfect and often wicked people that put Jesus in the position of needing to die for us in the first place.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">We are to call out and correct each other of sin no matter how people react to that kind of preaching.</li></ul></body></html>
