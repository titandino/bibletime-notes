<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Love is represented as an action here through Christ's sacrifice of His own life.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">It is another example of the difference that Christians and secular people have in terms of the definition of love.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Love is not a feeling, it is a choice. The feelings follow up on the choice and are much more real and longer lasting.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Love also goes well beyond personal grudges. If someone has hurt you in the past and has asked you for forgiveness and tried to move on from it, so should we. The same way Jesus forgives us of our sins when we come to Him in genuine repentance.</li></ul></body></html>
