<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Peter-Contesse: &quot;The idea here is of one gaining something that belongs to another person by means other than outright theft. It usually involves trickery of some kind.&quot;</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The idea of theft itself involves the assumption that personal property exists and can be stolen in the first place.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This would also assume that any economic/political system that does not recognize the ownership of private property and would instead put it under ownership of the collective or state will never succeed as they reject the premise that God has set up from the beginning.</li></ul></body></html>
