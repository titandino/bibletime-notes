<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The different specifications when it is an offering unrelated to the cleansing of sin is interesting.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This kind of offering seems more akin to when we come to God in gratitude for the things He has done or to ask something of Him.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">God has a lower barrier-to-entry regarding male/female for offerings that are more meant to bring praise and fellowship between us and Him.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The absolute best parts of the offering were to be reserved to God as usual, though. God deserves the best from all of us.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The banning of eating blood was probably because of how many extremely satanic pagan rituals often have to do with blood drinking/eating.</li></ul></body></html>
