<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Not all healing miracles are the same, yet most are the same and have patterns to them. 
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 2;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">All healing miracles are undeniable.</li></ul></li>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 2;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">There was always a witness and always validation. It was never done in private.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Aeneas and Tabitha were never questioned about whether they were really paralyzed or dead. No account of someone faking it is possible.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">These healings were always instantaneous and fully complete. There was no gradual healing process or relapses back into sickness.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">All healing miracles have greater purpose. When the healing miracles occur in the Bible, it always has a greater reason that lies in the glory of God being recognized.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">All healing miracles resulted in the salvation of others or the one directly involved. The highlight of every healing miracle is a large turning to the Lord for salvation. (v. 42, v35)</li></ul>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Aeneas is an unbeliever who was unfamiliar with Peter. Possibly not even someone who knew Peter let alone spoke to him before.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The healing seems to have been for the glory of God to bring another to faith in Christ.</li></ul></body></html>
