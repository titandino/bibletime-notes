<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">One of John's biggest understandings of Jesus is that He is eternal and has been alongside the Father from the beginning of time itself.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">John also clarifies that what he is writing is coming from actual physical contact with Jesus and has had a personal relationship with Him.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This same relationship is the kind that Jesus still wants with all of us.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Word (logos in the way I understand it from greek philosophy anyways), is saying Jesus is the core of knowledge, understanding, organization, and reasoned argument for the entire universe. Jesus is the best reasoned argument for God wanting an intimate relationship with us.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Jesus also is the pure embodiment of God's reason and understanding of our human condition and God's divine purpose for us.</li></ul></body></html>
