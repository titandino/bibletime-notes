<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Just because we feel like God has forgotten about us or another person doesn't mean it is true. Feelings are some of the most aggregious liars there are. God is always aware of people's suffering and is not the one responsible for this suffering.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">God's ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts. His purpose and reason for everything is way above anything we can comprehend.</p></body></html>
