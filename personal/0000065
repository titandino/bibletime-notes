<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:12pt; font-weight:600;">Being steadfast in faith and generosity is worthy of boasting.</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"><li style=" font-size:12pt; font-weight:600;" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:10pt; font-weight:400;">Do we see the needs of others as an inconvenience, or an opportunity to help and serve?</span></li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Paul was intentional in these three commendations. Steadfast faith in persecutions and afflictions are worthy of commendation. One third of the church is entirely gone from church as a result of Covid in the US.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">We weren't even persecuted as church or afflicted. The reason for leaving was it being a convenient off-ramp to leave, or a reason of preference (should we be meeting at all or should we be wearing a mask or not?).</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">If this weakness and shallow behavior is possible through something as insignificant as covid, then what on earth will real persecution do to the American church?</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">What will happen when it becomes illegal to have a bible? What happens when it becomes fireable to share Christ at work? Would we be the ones to stand up to it and continue in our service and faith regardless?</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">If we can't even stand when our country is having a bad flu season, how do we expect to stand if the country ends up at real war?</li></ul></body></html>
