<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He never acknowledges or repents of his sin, he only realizes the consequences of his sin and wants to avoid that. Similar to that of a cat. An animal.</li>
<li style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He seeks no reconciliation with the Lord for what he has done. He is just afraid of what happens when he gets caught in power-hungry greed.</li></ul></body></html>
